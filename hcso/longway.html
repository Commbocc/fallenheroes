                    -- Deputy Mark Longway</em></p>
                  <p>Deputy Mark A. Longway died on September 21, 2010, in a traffic crash while driving his patrol car. Deputy Longway was assigned to the Homeland Security Division/Port Security.</p>
                  <p>Deputy Longway, 48, joined the Sheriff’s Office in July 2004. He served in the Patrol Division before being reassigned earlier this year to the Port Security detail. </p>
                  <p>Deputy Longway was a decorated veteran of the U.S. Air Force, having earned numerous medals and accolades during his military service. He served our nation for 21 years. Mark decided to become a deputy after hearing about a hiring initiative while at MacDill Air Force Base. He knew he wanted to continue serving his fellow citizens.</p>
                  <p>Mark was selected to be one of HCSO’s first recipients of the Integrity Grant scholarship. The Could You Answer The Call? program utilized federal grant money to target outstanding deputy cadets and offer them a monthly stipend and tuition for our law enforcement academy. Mark fit the bill perfectly.</p>
                  <p>As Mark once noted, “This [deputy’s] uniform is just a different color. I’m still serving. First it was my country, now it is my county.’’ Wonderful words from one of our heroes.</p>
                  <p>Deputy Longway was an outstanding law enforcement officer. Among his accomplishments: he once helped save a suicidal man from jumping off the roof of a business. In another instance, Deputy Longway’s compassion and professional manner was noted by a citizen in a survey. The citizen gave him a rating of “excellent’’ in every category, an accomplishment few deputies achieved. That distinction earned him a Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office commendation for making a lasting impression on a citizen. </p>
                  <p>Deputy Longway leaves behind a wife, two daughters, and three grandchildren.</p>
                  <p>Deputy Longway, thank you for your service to our nation and to our county. We are proud to have called you a friend and colleague.</p></td>
