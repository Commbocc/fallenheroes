On Sept. 11, 2009, Hillsborough County and the City of Tampa opened Heroes Plaza to honor all of those honored veterans who have served in all of our wars, as well as police, fire, and emergency responders who have lost their lives in the line of duty.

Heroes Plaza is located at Cotanchobee Fort Brooke Park, 601 Old Water St. in downtown Tampa, next to the Tampa Bay History Center. This central location was chosen so all residents can conveniently visit the Plaza and pay tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, as well as those who currently serve and risk their lives daily for our freedom and safety.

Residents who visit the plaza can read the names of our communityâ€™s fallen heroes etched on monuments, and appreciate artwork commissioned to represent the danger that our soldiers, police, deputies and firefighters face every day.

Hillsborough County donated $1 million to the project. The City of Tampa donated about $3 million and currently manages the site.
