                    <br />
Officer Curtis stopped a vehicle because it did not have a visible license  plate. He called for an additional unit to assist him because a male passenger  in the car was wanted on a misdemeanor charge for writing a worthless check.  When Officer Curtis arrived, he and Officer Kocab attempted to arrest the  suspect. The suspect drew a weapon and shot both officers at close range.<br />
<br />
A witness called 911 to report the shooting. Officer Kocab died shortly after  arriving at the hospital and Officer Curtis was pronounced dead a few hours  later.<br />
<br />
The suspect surrendered and was taken into custody four days later.<br />
<br />
31 year old Jeffrey Kocab had nearly 14 months as a Tampa Police Officer. He  moved through the Tampa Police Departmentâ€™s training program at an accelerated  pace because of his outstanding police skills and commitment to solving crime.</p>
Officer Kocab served with the Plant City Police  Department prior to joining the Tampa Police Department. There he was named the  2007 Officer of the Year. He was also chosen as the agency's Officer of the  Month four times over a three year period.<br />
<br />
A Michigan  native, Officer Kocab married his best friend Sara and the two were expecting  the birth of their first child. He had a passion for the Arts and coached young  actors with the Children's Theater of Florida. In his spare time, he enjoyed  studying Brazilian Jujitsu at Russ Cross' World  Fighting Arts  Center in Haines City, Florida  and participating in paintball tournaments.</td>
