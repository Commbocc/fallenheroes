                <td width="78%" valign="top"><p>On August 19, 2009 at 9:58p.m. Corporal  Michael Roberts was patrolling on Nebraska    Avenue in a neighborhood that recently experienced  several burglaries. He observed a suspicious person pushing a shopping cart  full of items and initiated a stop. The suspect began struggling with the  Corporal who attempted to use his taser. The suspect ran across Nebraska Avenue at East Arctic Street  and the officer chased him on foot. They began fighting again on the west side  of Nebraska Avenue  when the suspect pulled out a gun and began pistol whipping the officer. He  then fired one shot. The bullet hit Corporal Roberts on the right side of his  chest area that was not covered by his bulletproof vest. Witnesses observed the  suspect run back to the shopping cart and remove a large canvas bag. </p>
                  <p>At 10:03 p.m. Corporal Roberts’ Sergeant  pulled up and observed the suspect running from the scene. The suspect then  pulled out an AR-15 assault rifle from a canvas bag and pointed it at the  Sergeant. The suspect then took off running and the Sergeant ran to help.  Corporal Roberts was transported to Tampa    General Hospital  where he was pronounced dead at 10:50 p.m. </p>
                  <p>A K-9 officer tracked the suspect to 812 Yukon Street  where he surrendered to police. Two witnesses saw the suspect pistol whip and  shoot Corporal Roberts.  The suspect was  charged with 1st Degree Murder of a Law Enforcement Officer, Aggravated Assault  of a Law Enforcement Officer (pointed rifle at Sergeant), Carrying a Concealed  Firearm.</p>
                  <p>38-year-old Corporal Michael Roberts will be  remembered as an outstanding officer, husband, father and member of the Tampa  Police Department family. He began his career with the Tampa Police Department  in 1998. He served in Patrol until 2005 when he became a K-9 Officer. He served  one year as a Field Training Officer and was promoted to the rank of Corporal  on July 12, 2009. Roberts was honored with a Life Saving Award in 2005. During  his 11-year career, he was awarded dozens of letters of appreciation from  citizens, supervisors and other law enforcement agencies. He served with the  U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army. <br />
                  </p>
                  He is survived by his wife and  3-year-old son. He was a dedicated family man. Mike was known for his sense of  humor and practical jokes that could make anyone smile. He was an avid sports  fan and played goalie on a TPD Hockey Team.</td>
