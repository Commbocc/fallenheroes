                    <br />
Officer Curtis stopped a vehicle because it did not have a visible license  plate. He called for an additional unit to assist him because a male passenger  in the car was wanted on a misdemeanor charge for writing a worthless check.  When Officer Curtis arrived, he and Officer Kocab attempted to arrest the  suspect. The suspect drew a weapon and shot both officers at close range.<br />
<br />
A witness called 911 to report the shooting. Officer Kocab died shortly after  arriving at the hospital and Officer Curtis was pronounced dead a few hours  later.<br />
<br />
The suspect surrendered and was taken into custody four days later. <br />
31  year old David Curtis had three years and eight months of service with the  Tampa Police Department. He came to the department from the Hillsborough County  Sheriff's Office where he served as a detention deputy.&nbsp; Officer Curtis  was an outstanding Tampa Police Officer who served in all three Tampa Police  districts.&nbsp; He also worked on the plain clothes Rapid Offender Control  squad known as ROC prior to his current assignment in District Three. </p>
Officer  Curtis was a member of the department's Honor Guard for two and a half years.  In May 2010, he attended National Law Enforcement Memorial Week in Washington, DC.  He stood post at the candlelight vigil and wreath ceremony honoring fallen  officers from around the country including Corporal Mike Roberts.<br />
<br />
A true family man by all accounts, Officer Curtis was devoted to his wife and  four sons, Hunter, Tyler, Sean and Austin. He loved telling stories about his  children and the many adventures they had together. Officer Curtis also enjoyed  the outdoors. He frequently swam in a lake near his home with his three Labradors and took a pleasure in fishing.</td>
