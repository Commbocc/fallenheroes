It is with mixed emotions - immense pride and sadness - that our grateful community honors the Hillsborough County First Responders who have died while in the performance of their duties for our citizens.

Hillsborough County’s Fallen Heroes – the firefighters, law enforcement, and paramedics are to be forever remembered for their unquestioned valor and sacrifice, serving to defend our community’s commitment to the fundamental principles of safety and justice for all.

This virtual memorial will serve as our reminder of the sacrifices that those firefighters, law enforcement, and paramedics made each day to ensure that our families and loved ones are safe. Each ultimately gave their lives in service to our community, in making Hillsborough County a better, safer place to live, work and play.
