Sergeant Pricher was struck and killed by a drunk driver while assisting stranded bus passengers on I-4. He and five other officers were returning from a tactical response team seminar when they stopped to offer their assistance. While on the roadway a vehicle swerved and struck Sergeant Pricher and then fled the scene. The suspect was later apprehended and charged with manslaughter, drunk driving, and hit-and-run.
