Officers David Curtis and Jeffrey Kocab were shot and killed while attempting to make an arrest at a traffic stop.

Officer Curtis stopped a vehicle because it did not have a visible license plate. He called for an additional unit to assist him because a male passenger in the car was wanted on a misdemeanor charge for writing a worthless check. When Officer Curtis arrived, he and Officer Kocab attempted to arrest the suspect. The suspect drew a weapon and shot both officers at close range.

A witness called 911 to report the shooting. Officer Kocab died shortly after arriving at the hospital and Officer Curtis was pronounced dead a few hours later.

The suspect surrendered and was taken into custody four days later.
31 year old David Curtis had three years and eight months of service with the Tampa Police Department. He came to the department from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office where he served as a detention deputy.  Officer Curtis was an outstanding Tampa Police Officer who served in all three Tampa Police districts.  He also worked on the plain clothes Rapid Offender Control squad known as ROC prior to his current assignment in District Three.

Officer Curtis was a member of the department's Honor Guard for two and a half years. In May 2010, he attended National Law Enforcement Memorial Week in Washington, DC. He stood post at the candlelight vigil and wreath ceremony honoring fallen officers from around the country including Corporal Mike Roberts.

A true family man by all accounts, Officer Curtis was devoted to his wife and four sons, Hunter, Tyler, Sean and Austin. He loved telling stories about his children and the many adventures they had together. Officer Curtis also enjoyed the outdoors. He frequently swam in a lake near his home with his three Labradors and took a pleasure in fishing.
