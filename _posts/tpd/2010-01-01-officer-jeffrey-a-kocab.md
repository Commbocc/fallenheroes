Officers Jeffrey Kocab and David Curtis were shot and killed while attempting to make an arrest at a traffic stop.

Officer Curtis stopped a vehicle because it did not have a visible license plate. He called for an additional unit to assist him because a male passenger in the car was wanted on a misdemeanor charge for writing a worthless check. When Officer Curtis arrived, he and Officer Kocab attempted to arrest the suspect. The suspect drew a weapon and shot both officers at close range.

A witness called 911 to report the shooting. Officer Kocab died shortly after arriving at the hospital and Officer Curtis was pronounced dead a few hours later.

The suspect surrendered and was taken into custody four days later.

31 year old Jeffrey Kocab had nearly 14 months as a Tampa Police Officer. He moved through the Tampa Police Departmentâ€™s training program at an accelerated pace because of his outstanding police skills and commitment to solving crime.

Officer Kocab served with the Plant City Police Department prior to joining the Tampa Police Department. There he was named the 2007 Officer of the Year. He was also chosen as the agency's Officer of the Month four times over a three year period.

A Michigan native, Officer Kocab married his best friend Sara and the two were expecting the birth of their first child. He had a passion for the Arts and coached young actors with the Children's Theater of Florida. In his spare time, he enjoyed studying Brazilian Jujitsu at Russ Cross' World Fighting Arts Center in Haines City, Florida and participating in paintball tournaments.
