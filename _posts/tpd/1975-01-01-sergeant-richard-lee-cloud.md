Sergeant Cloud was assassinated by the mob seven months after losing his job with the Tampa Police Department. After losing his job he worked on a federal task force fighting drug dealing and organized crime. He was assassinated when he answered his door at his home in Seminole Heights. The suspect was arrested and executed in the late 1970s.

After his death the Tampa Police Department posthumously reinstated Sergeant Cloud back to Sergeant.
