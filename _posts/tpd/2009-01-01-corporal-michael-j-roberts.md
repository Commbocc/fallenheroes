On August 19, 2009 at 9:58p.m. Corporal Michael Roberts was patrolling on Nebraska Avenue in a neighborhood that recently experienced several burglaries. He observed a suspicious person pushing a shopping cart full of items and initiated a stop. The suspect began struggling with the Corporal who attempted to use his taser. The suspect ran across Nebraska Avenue at East Arctic Street and the officer chased him on foot. They began fighting again on the west side of Nebraska Avenue when the suspect pulled out a gun and began pistol whipping the officer. He then fired one shot. The bullet hit Corporal Roberts on the right side of his chest area that was not covered by his bulletproof vest. Witnesses observed the suspect run back to the shopping cart and remove a large canvas bag.

At 10:03 p.m. Corporal Robertsâ€™ Sergeant pulled up and observed the suspect running from the scene. The suspect then pulled out an AR-15 assault rifle from a canvas bag and pointed it at the Sergeant. The suspect then took off running and the Sergeant ran to help. Corporal Roberts was transported to Tampa General Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 10:50 p.m.
