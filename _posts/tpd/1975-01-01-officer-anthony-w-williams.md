Patrolman Williams was shot and killed when he interrupted an armed robbery at a convenience store while off duty. A reserve deputy from a neighboring agency was also in the back room, waiting to make an arrest attempt. A gunfight ensued and Patrolman Williams was fatally wounded. His wife, also a police officer, was able to retrieve his weapon and take the suspects into custody.
