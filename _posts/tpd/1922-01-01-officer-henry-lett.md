Officer Lett was shot and killed as he and his partner attempted to arrest a man for disorderly conduct. The officers had responded to a call of a man threatening to shoot a woman. As they approached him he ran into an alley and drew his weapon. Officer Lett returned fire at the same time and both were wounded. Officer Lett later succumbed to his wounds.
