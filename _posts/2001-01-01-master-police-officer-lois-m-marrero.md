Officer Lois Marrero was shot and killed when she was ambushed by a bank robber during a foot chase.

The suspect had just robbed a bank branch and ran into an apartment complex with Officer Marrero in pursuit. He hid behind a car and shot her as she neared his location. A second officer was shot and wounded during the shootout. The suspect then fled into a nearby apartment, took hostages, and then committed suicide several hours later during a standoff.

An accomplice to the robbery was sentenced to life in prison on June 23, 2003.

Officer Marrero had been employed with the Tampa Police Department for 18 years, and is survived by her life companion, who also serves as an officer with the department. Officer Marrero is the first female officer from her department to be killed in the line of duty.
