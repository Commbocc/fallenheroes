Hillsborough County has established a system by which private citizens, organizations, and businesses can make donations for the families of Fallen Heroes while being assured that 100% of their donation goes to the families. When a First Responder dies in the line of duty, the County will establish an escrow account to be held open for 90 days from the day of the tragedy. At the end of this 90 day period, all of the donated funds will be issued to the fallen first responder's family. The private funds donated into this account will be in addition to the amount provided to the families by the County under this policy.



### Please make checks payable to:

__Hillsborough County BOCC__

Donors should write the name of the Fallen Hero in the memo line of the check.

__Mailing address:__

Hillsborough County Management & Budget Department \\
c/o Fallen Heroes Fund \\
P.O. Box 1110, 26th Floor \\
Tampa, Florida 33601-1110

*The County does not accept credit card donations.*

Donations to the fund that cannot be associated with a specific First Responder will be accumulated and distributed to eligible beneficiaries in shares proportionate to the distribution of County funds. Hillsborough County’s Management & Budget Department is the Program Administrator for the fund and will make final decisions regarding the equitable distribution of funds in accordance with the Board of County Commissioner’s Fallen Heroes Program policy. Delivery of a check to the First Responder’s family will be as stated in [Board Policy](http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/DocumentCenter/Home/View/2255) – Section Number 10.06.00.00, "It is the responsibility of the Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners to designate a Board Member or member of the County Administrator’s staff to deliver the funds on behalf of the County".
